Be sure to include stdio.h at the top of your file.

When printing out the swapped strings, be sure to put a newline after each string.

When you make a character array, be sure to make an extra space for the null-character.
This will tell printf where the end of the string is.
For example if you have a 5-character string, make the char array of size 6: 5 characters plus
1 null-character at the end.  If you fail to do so, you may get odd outputs like this:

data 74 $ ./swap 125 945
145
925P

In the main() function, the arguments are (int argc, char const *argv[]).
You use these to interact with the arguments that are passed to a program.

char * argv[]  is just another way to write  char argv[][].

The null character is written like this:  char nullChar = '\0';
